The mesh files are:
-	stationCoord_Fig3_exp22_exp40.txt
-	stationCoord_Fig3_exp29.txt
-	stationCoord_Fig4.txt
-	stationCoord_Table4.txt
These files were generated by the MATLAB function 'PPGstations.m' in the folder 'Code/MATLAB'. Here, 'Fig' and 'Table' refer to the corresponding figure and table in the paper, 'exp' refers
to the corresponding experiment. If no experiment number is given, then the mesh was used for all experiments.
In order to use one of the above files for the simulation, rename it to 'stationCoord.txt'.

The structure of file 'PARAMS_UopenField_meteo5606.txt' in folder output is as follows
	<line number>	<u_*> 	<L>		<stack height>	<wind direction>	<meso scale variability>
The structure of file 'PARAMS_KTaylorOF_meteo5606.txt' in folder output is as follows
	<line number>	<\sigma_u>	<\sigma_v> 	<\sigma_w> 	<A> 	<u_*> 	<L>	 <stack height> 	<ABL height>
with
-	\sigma the standard deviation of the respective wind component
-	u_* the friction velocity
-	L	the Monin-Obukhov parameter
-	A = 1.4*u_*/(-\kappa*L)^(1/3) if -200 m < L < 0 and 0 otherwise.

The files 'script_stable.pbs' and 'script_unstable.pbs' show how the code could be runned to simulate the concentrations in a stable or unstable atmosphere respectively.
The executable slowConc is used to generate the KS data.
The executable fastConc is used to generate the PI data.

In file 'inputDict_orig', the value of the following fields can be ignored:
-	diameter
-	flowRate
-	gasTemp
-	humidityType
-	windVarType
-	zref
-	zrefTemp
-	zrefTemp0
-	zrefWindVar
These could be used to calculate the input parameters, but these files are already given in the folder output.
The content of file meteo5606 can also be ignored, now it is only used to determine the number of times that the meteodata needs to be refreshed (one is this case).
