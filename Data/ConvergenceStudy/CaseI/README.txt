The mesh file and cell volume file still need to be added to this folder, which can be found with the model output in the KS and PI folders.
The file names are:
-	stationCoord.txt
-	cellVolumes.txt
These files were generated by the MATLAB functions 'writeList.m' and 'writeCellVolumes.m' in the folder 'Code/MATLAB' using the parameters reported in the file 'meshSettings.txt',
which can be found together with the model output in the KS and PI folders.

The structure of file 'PARAMS_UopenField_meteo5606.txt' in folder output is as follows
	<line number>	<u_*> 	<L>		<stack height>	<wind direction>	<meso scale variability>
The structure of file 'PARAMS_KTaylorOF_meteo5606.txt' in folder output is as follows
	<line number>	<\sigma_u>	<\sigma_v> 	<\sigma_w> 	<A> 	<u_*> 	<L>	 <stack height> 	<ABL height>
with
-	\sigma the standard deviation of the respective wind component
-	u_* the friction velocity
-	L	the Monin-Obukhov parameter
-	A = 1.4*u_*/(-\kappa*L)^(1/3) if -200 m < L < 0.

The file 'script.pbs' shows how the code could be runned to generate the MISE data.
The executable slowMISE is used to generate the KS data.
The executable fastV3MISE is used to generate the PI data.
In order to generate the MISE data, the file 'CONC_PUFF0.txt' still need to be placed in the folder 'output/puffReleases_meteo5606.txt'. 
The file 'CONC_PUFF0.txt' can be found with the model output in the KS and PI folders or can be generated by adding the option '-refSolution' to the called executable (see 'script.pbs').

In file 'inputDict_orig', the value of the following fields can be ignored:
-	diameter
-	flowRate
-	gasTemp
-	humidityType
-	windVarType
-	zref
-	zrefTemp
-	zrefTemp0
-	zrefWindVar
These could be used to calculate the input parameters, but these files are already given in the folder output.
The content of file meteo5606 can also be ignored, now it is only used to determine the number of times that the meteodata needs to be refreshed (one is this case).
